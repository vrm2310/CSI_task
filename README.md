# CSI_task
Here, i have cloned a website of Nexcent using the template and images provided to us.
The logos were not in the data sent to us, so that i have sourced from outside (google search)
The website is made using HTML, CSS and JS.
JS is used to check whether the email id entered by the user is a valid email or not.
